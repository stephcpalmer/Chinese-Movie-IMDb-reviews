## Objective
In this project I aim to analyze user reviews of Chinese movies from the IMDb website and draw some inferences about the western audience's perception of Chinese cinema.

## Motivation
This project is the final project of Professor Vierthaler's Spring 2021 CHIN 303 "Hacking Chinese Studies" class at William & Mary. From the time I was in high school, I have been beguiled by Chinese tv shows and movies. This interest in Chinese programs lead to me taking over 20 Chinese Studies credits at William & Mary even though most of them did not satisfy any of my liberal arts requirements. Thankfully, in my last semester at the College, I have found a class that intersects my academic focus in Applied Mathematics and my interest in Chinese language and culture. Hence, in the final project I wished to analyze Chinese movies, and since I am aware of IMDb's available datasets, and in my previous programming classes I have not learned how to web scrape, my ideas manifested as sourcing my analysis of Chinese movie user reviews from IMDb.

## Gathering Data

### IMDb Datasets

IMDb has subsets of their data [available](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) for personal and non-commercial use. I downloaded the data from three of their datasets: title.akas, title.basics, and title.ratings by using the urllib package for Python.

```
import urllib.request

#retrieve zipped files

Title_akas_request = urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.akas.tsv.gz','Title_akas.tsv.gz')
Title_basics_request = urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz','Title_basics.tsv.gz')
Title_ratings_request = urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.ratings.tsv.gz','Title_ratings.tsv.gz')

```
