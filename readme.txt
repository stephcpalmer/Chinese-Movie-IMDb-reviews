This project is the final project of Professor Vierthaler's Spring 2021 CHIN 303 "Hacking Chinese Studies" class at William & Mary. From the time I was in high school, I have been beguiled by Chinese tv shows and movies. This interest in Chinese programs lead to me taking over 20 Chinese Studies credits at William & Mary even though most of them did not satisfy any of my liberal arts requirements. Thankfully, in my last semester at the College, I have found a class that intersects my academic focus in Applied Mathematics and my interest in Chinese language and culture. Hence, in the final project I wished to analyze Chinese movies, and since I am aware of IMDb's available datasets, and in my previous programming classes I have not learned how to web scrape, my ideas manifested as sourcing my analysis of Chinese movie user reviews from IMDb.
